    <h1>Reflection of the entire course</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>What had been seen in the last eight weeks and what has been learn out of it</h2>
        <p>Well one I remember how to do the colors just by typing the names and injusting their shade and two I did manage to get the borders right and the max-width and the box-shadow and the border-radius of however I want my creation to look like. And finally three the Quiz'es I would take notes of what I learn out of them for better remember use since the Quiz'es are the most managed works I could ever done since it feels like remembering a book you just read.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>What could be changed from this course</h2>
        <p>I would change nothing about the course since I dont complain as much and I like to get to the point and keeping things simple without going full socrotiese and just write down an entire paragraph thats longer than a weeks worth of a document.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>what was expected to learn about</h2>
        <p>I was expected to learn the most difficult code that will be hard as balls to remember and I was right since coding is one of the hardest things to do if you are Autistic unless the creativity ends up sparking again.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>What concepts were new and now not so new anymore due to learning it</h2>
        <p>That would be the borders and the typography and the grid and the bootstrap and github pages which I despise with all my heart but at least I learn about the borders and the colors and the styles of what I want my creation to look like if I put more effort into it and just say fuck this and just make whatever I want if I put my imagination in it.</p>
